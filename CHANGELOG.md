# Changelog

## Version 2

### 2.0.0

- NOTE! Non-backwards-compatible update: Requirement for ACF Pro removed. Custom fields are added using CMB2 instead. This means articles added before 2.0 will need to be re-added using updated UI. Please use version 1.* is this is not feasible for your project.



## Version 1 (legacy - Requires ACF Pro)

### 1.3.0
- Adds support for Wordpress 5.0 (with ACF 5.8.4+)
- Fixed issue with text editor being hidden for video and image backgrounds
